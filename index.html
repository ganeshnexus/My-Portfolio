                </h3>

                <p>
                    I am an Operations Manager at Soft Standard Solutions with 14+ years of experience in the US IT
                    Staffing industry, responsible for end-to-end operations across recruitment, bench sales, payroll
                    coordination, compliance, and delivery management.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Starting my career as a Bench Sales Recruiter, I’ve grown through leadership roles to managing
                    operations at scale. This hands-on journey has given me a strong understanding of the staffing
                    lifecycle—from sourcing and placements to consultant management, client coordination, and process
                    governance. My leadership approach focuses on accountability, process discipline, team development,
                    and results, while maintaining transparency and collaboration across departments.
                </p>

                <p>I am deeply passionate about the US IT staffing domain and continuously work toward building
                    scalable operations, strong teams, and sustainable growth.
